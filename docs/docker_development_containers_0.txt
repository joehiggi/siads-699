- In general
	- Docker dev(elopment) containers need to be opened in Microsoft Visual Studio code
	- Docker dev containers are a newer iteration of docker containers specific to software engineering
		- Instead of opening a docker container with MS VS code every time a team wants to develop - dev containers will open auto in env
	- You can select "Reopen Folder Locally" if you do not want to open a VSCode window with a devcontainer activated

- Next steps
	- We will connect this devcontainer to a postgresql database
